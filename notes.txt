Wed Sept 15th:

    - location of agents
    - paramterize different params
    - evaluate risk of non-vaccinated

    Overall:
        - run different simuations of sources and sinks and make sense of that data
            to see hot zones in a room

        - weird source/sink locations

        - different combinations
            2 source 2 sink

        - locations of infectious people
            one on each corner

        - try breaking it

        - multiple infectious individuals

    In order:
        - locations of source/sink
        - numbers of source/sink
        - who is infectious (one in each corner, one in middle)
        - map areas of risk --> normalize on worst case scenario (highest viral load across all experiments)
        - publishable figures


Wed Sept 22nd:
---

    - document sim_params.json in README.md
    - TODO make sure all sim_params.json can take multiple in room.py and simulation
    - where did numbers come from --> citations also in README.md
    - explain how the model works in README.md
    - mention easy parameters to control and how to change and run the simulation
    - how do we do time? --> into minutes

    - start trying to breaking this, values that dont work

    - define risk?? For given paramaters in sim_params.json

    - come up with source/sink locations drawing --> ask John
