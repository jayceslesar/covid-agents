    - location of agents
    - paramterize different params
    - evaluate risk of non-vaccinated

    Overall:
        - run different simuations of sources and sinks and make sense of that data
            to see hot zones in a room

        - weird source/sink locations

        - different combinations
            2 source 2 sink

        - locations of infectious people
            one on each corner

        - try breaking it

        - multiple infectious individuals

    In order:
        - locations of source/sink
        - numbers of source/sink
        - who is infectious (one in each corner, one in middle)
        - map areas of risk --> normalize on worst case scenario (highest viral load across all experiments)
        - publishable figures


Wed Sept 22nd:
---

    - document sim_params.json in README.md
    - TODO make sure all sim_params.json can take multiple in room.py and simulation
    - where did numbers come from --> citations also in README.md
    - explain how the model works in README.md
    - mention easy parameters to control and how to change and run the simulation
    - how do we do time? --> into minutes

    - start trying to breaking this, values that dont work

    - define risk?? For given paramaters in sim_params.json

    - come up with source/sink locations drawing --> ask John

    - https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/randomForest/randomForest.pdf document like so

    - consistency in words
    - use zotero to get citations looking good
    - clarify time (does changing 1 to 2 double the speed or halve it?) : done
    - make paramters list a table --> put in example values from simulations from above, column for units (when appropriate), give examples of booleans to use : done
    - add to introduction for program requirements (python3), using specific version : done
    - give json example : done
    - example under how to run section
    - autocreate data folder :  done
    - save last step as an image --> document and save certain steps : saves a gif already
    - add functionality to add multiple source/sinks : needs more testing

    - experiments:
        - try to break

    Pattern to use : teacher, all 4 corners, middle person

    What does a typical classroom look like?

    - Doors acting as source/sink in same location between experiments (either closest or furthest from teacher)
    - Windows doing the same on one side (across from the door(s))
    - No HVAC at all --> just open windows (just sinks)
    - Multiple people infectious and the level of infectiosness --> masking
    - Diagonals infected
    - Door locations and number of windows (2, 3, and 4 windows)
    experiments:

    ALL FOR x PATTERN INFECTED:
    `"INFECTED_AGENT_LOCS": [[1, 1], [1, 9], [5, 5], [9, 1], [9, 9]]}`

        sink and source clos to teacher (on same space) both_close

        sink and source far from teacher (on same space) both_far



    More Broad Questions:

    - Bivariate comparisons --> less risk to class if windows are sink vs source
                            --> of windows, windows are sink..how does risk change on amount same for source
                            --> students more at risk of teacher is infectious vs student
                            --> locations with least total inhalation of infected aerosols

    - Comparing --> either one student over time who is never infectious over experiments
                --> boxplot where each boxplot is from a different but related simulation and the values are aerosols inhaled

    - later...optimization --> what is the optimal locations for source and sinks given we can only have one of each


    REAL EXPERIMENTS:

        1/6 possible people infected (top right, bottom right, top left, bottom left, middle, teacher)

        door in either top left or bottom left acting as sink/source

            2, 3, 4 windows on opposite side of door acting as the opposite of source and sink

        boxplot where each boxplot is the AUC of all non-infected people


    Optimization:
        For a given room...
            All combinations of one source and one sink where there isnt an agent
            1 infected person top left 1 in bottom right
